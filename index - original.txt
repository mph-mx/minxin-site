This curated selection of books is tailored specifically for teenagers, offering a range of genres, themes, and reading levels. Reading for pleasure opens doors to new worlds, builds empathy, and strengthens language skills. Whether you're just starting your reading journey or looking for a literary challenge, there's something here for you.</p><p>The book list is divided into four reading levels to help you choose titles that match your current comfort and encourage steady growth. Click on a level below to explore books that fit your comfort zone—or challenge yourself to try something a bit harder!</p><h2>Reading Levels</h2><ul class='lexile-list'><li><a href='explorer.html'><strong>Explorer</strong></a> - <p>Explorer books are perfect if you want a story you can jump into quickly. The chapters are usually shorter, the language is clear, and the plots move fast, so you won’t feel stuck on every page. These books are great if you’re building confidence in English or you just want something fun to read between homework and activities.</p></li><li><a href='adventurer.html'><strong>Adventurer</strong></a> - <p>Adventurer books are a step up: they’re still very readable, but the stories are a bit longer and the ideas a bit deeper. You’ll meet more complex characters, richer settings, and some tricky new vocabulary. Choose from this shelf if you already enjoy reading in English and you’re ready for a little more challenge in exchange for a bigger adventure.</p></li><li><a href='voyager.html'><strong>Voyager</strong></a> - <p>Voyager books are for readers who like to get completely lost in a story. The language can be more detailed, the plots more layered, and the themes more thought-provoking. These are ideal if you’re comfortable reading in English, don’t mind longer chapters, and want books that make you think, feel, and maybe even argue with the characters in your head.</p></li><li><a href='galactic.html'><strong>Galactic</strong></a> - <p>Galactic books are the epic journeys of our library: big ideas, powerful writing, and stories that stay with you for a long time. They often use more advanced vocabulary, complex structures, and mature themes, so they’re best if you’re already a confident reader in English and ready to push yourself further. If you love a serious reading challenge and want books that feel almost like adult novels, this is your galaxy.</p></li></ul><h2>Genres</h2><div class='genres-list'><a href='genre_adventure_and_survival.html'>Adventure & Survival</a><a href='genre_classics_and_canon.html'>Classics & Canon</a><a href='genre_fantasy_worlds.html'>Fantasy Worlds</a><a href='genre_historical_and_war.html'>Historical & War</a><a href='genre_horror_and_supernatural.html'>Horror & Supernatural</a><a href='genre_humour_and_feelgood.html'>Humour & Feel-Good</a><a href='genre_mystery_crime_and_thrillers.html'>Mystery, Crime & Thrillers</a><a href='genre_nonfiction_biography_and_memoir.html'>Non-Fiction, Biography & Memoir</a><a href='genre_poetry_verse_and_short_stories.html'>Poetry, Verse & Short Stories</a><a href='genre_reference_study_and_dictionaries.html'>Reference, Study & Dictionaries</a><a href='genre_romance_and_relationships.html'>Romance & Relationships</a><a href='genre_school_family_and_growing_up.html'>School, Family & Growing Up</a><a href='genre_scifi_and_dystopia.html'>Sci-Fi & Dystopia</a><a href='genre_social_issues_and_justice.html'>Social Issues & Justice</a><a href='genre_sport.html'>Sport</a></div><p>Explore our book lists by reading level or genre, or head to the <a href='search.html'>Search</a> page to filter by both!</p></div><footer>Minxin School &copy; 2025</footer></body></html>
